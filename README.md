# 🛠️ How I Work

👋 Hello there!

This is an evolving document that outlines the tools, workflows, and philosophies I use as a Software Engineer.

It includes how I organise my time, communicate, lead teams, manage projects, and work efficiently.

To learn more about about me - see [this page](https://github.com/aleksgorbenko/whoami).

## 🧠 Philosophy

- Outcomes > output
- People-first - [Peopleware](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Peopleware-Productive-Projects-Tom-DeMarco/dp/0932633439)
- Ask "What are we trying to achieve here and why?" often
- KISS - reduce cognitive load whenever possible, in code, in written communication, in file structures
- Help educate non-technical teams, use analogies and visualisations for explanations
- Measure progress. I recently discovered [DX Core 4](https://getdx.com/news/introducing-the-dx-core-4/), I haven't experienced it yet, but would love an opportunity to implement it
- Take of your tools and your tools will take care of you
- If it’s not documented, it doesn’t scale

## 📅 Planning & Tasks

- _lightweight_ GTD with [2Do](https://www.2doapp.com/). Smart Lists I have: active projects, service, every person I regularly interact with
- Timeboxing in Calendar
- Daily 10-min morning planning + 10-min shutdown ritual
- Weekly personal and team analysis on Friday
- [**Obsidian**](https://obsidian.md) for all my notes. Bootstrap repo - [Engineering Notebook](https://github.com/aleksgorbenko/engineering-notebook)
- Kanban board with a few columns: Backlog, Next, Doing, Blocked, Done and a few `product` and `type` labels
- Save links to chat messages & context in 2do's

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Automation

- [**Alfred**](https://alfred.app) for bookmarks, clipboard history, file search, snippets, repo navigation, and many more workflows that allow me to spend less time searching and more time doing
- [**Keyboard Maestro**](https://www.keyboardmaestro.com) for macros, advanced snippets
- Apple Shortcuts as alternative for Keyboard Maestro + usage on iOS
- [**iTerm**]() for terminal
- [**Magnet**](https://magnet.crowdcafe.com) for window management
- My [**dotfiles**](https://github.com/aleksgorbenko/dotfiles) for shell aliases, functions, etc.

---

## 👥 Team Management & Communication

- Daily team meetings to discuss any blockers > classic standup meeting
- 1:1 format (agenda + follow-up)
- New team-member onboarding checklist template
- Quarterly team member feedback cycles
- Team repo with wiki and index to all the knowledge to our team, our practices, processes
- Keep Team Brag File
- Regular remote/in-person socials to decompress and non-shop talk
- **Genuine** personal praise
- Celebrate small wins and share them
- Async-first: written proposals > meetings
- Slack Channels: `team`, `team-private`, `team-support`

---

## 🧪 Development Practices

- TDD
- Architectural decision records (ADR)
- CI/CD
- Git [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)
- Visualise everything - diagrams, flows, research material - it really helps
- Comment if code doesn't explain the Why
- Lightweight estimates in weeks with optimistic/pessimistic scenarios

---

## 📁 File & Project Organization

- Template everything: PR, ADRs, RFC, 101s, service README, etc. Templates live in [Engineering Notebook](https://github.com/aleksgorbenko/engineering-notebook) repo
- Runbooks in relevant repo wiki
- Simple consistent structure of information everywhere: local/cloud shared files, Obsidian notes, shared boards&diagrams in Lucid, 2do Project names

---

## ‼️ Incident Resolution & Debugging

- Clean consistent logs
- Saved log searches
- Links to log searches in incident message attributes
- Links to runbooks in incident message attributes
- Internal cli tooling to help investigation and resolution
- Blameless post-mortems
- Incident rehearsals

---

## 📚 Continuous Learning

- [Zettelkasten](https://zettelkasten.de/overview/) + [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) - personal knowledge management
- [Anki](https://ankiweb.net) - flashcards
- [My Substack Reading List](https://substack.com/@aleksgbko/reads) - weekly "Tech Newsletters" reading
- Books
